#  Day 04 - Earth
For today's submission the focus is on Earth, mapping landforms, geology, soil, agriculture, elevation, or anything solid beneath your feet.

I decided on a map of all allotments across Great Britain.

## The data
The data on allotment locations is from the Ordnance Survey Open Greenspace dataset. Available [here](https://osdatahub.os.uk/data/downloads/open/OpenGreenspace).

## The map
The map has been built in leaflet. Fairly simple processing of the greenspace data to filter for allotments and community growing spaces.
Interactive map available [here](https://rpubs.com/andy_wilson_nhstu/allotment_30dmc).
