# Day 11 - Minimal Map
The purpose of today's challenge is to create a map with the fewest possible elements. I have created a map that shows 
the population density of Australia using as minimal elements as possible. I.e. no underlying background tiles, no place 
names and only a single colour palette.

# Data

- Australian Bureau of Statistics on population estimates and density at Statistical Area Level 2 for 2024. Available [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/regional-population/latest-release#data-downloads).
