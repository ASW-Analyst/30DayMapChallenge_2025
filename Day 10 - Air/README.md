# Day 10 - Air
For Day 10 with the focus on Air I have created a shiny app to map the migration routes of one particular European Honey Buzzard called Lars.

The app is accessible [here](https://nhs-tu-andy-wilson.shinyapps.io/30DayMapChallenge_Day10_Air_Lars/).

The data was sourced from [MoveBank](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main) from this [study](https://datarepository.movebank.org/entities/datapackage/aae3de22-4736-45c0-bfcb-af0a4d57ba0f).
